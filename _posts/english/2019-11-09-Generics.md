### Generics_Part 1

Generics was introduced from JDK 1.5 and since then been serving as a major feature in using Java language. 

Generics is a function that does compile-time type checks for method or collection classes that deals with various types of objects; hence classes like HashSet, ArrayList, and HashMap make very good uses of generics. 
#### <span style="background-color: #DCDCDC">1. Basics </span>
##### Generics does...
> **enhances type stability** : it prevents objects from being saved in unintended types, and reduces errors when an object is taken out in a different type than its original type. <br>
> **simplifies the code** : it lets you omit writing codes for type checking and casting. 

```java
package Generics;

public class Person<T> {
    T language;
    void setLanguage(T language){
        this.language = language;
    }
    T getLanguage(){
        return this.language;
    }
}
```

- One thing to note is that 'T' can be substituted to basically any alphabet. Normally in case of arrayList, E (elements) is used; and for Map, K(key) and V(value) are often used. 

```java
        Person<String> person = new Person<>();
        person.setLanguage("Java");
        person.setLanguage(new Object()); //<---error!
```

- The once-mysterious type T is not fixed to be a String. Once defined such, it has same as writing the whole class with String substituting T. Hence the error from the third line above.

```java
        Person<String> person = new Person<String>();
        person.setLanguage("Java");
        person.setLanguage(new Object()); //<---error!
        
        Person<Integer> person2 = new Person<Integer>();
        person2.setLanguage("Python"); //<---error!
        person2.setLanguage(0);
```
- It is possible to make several Person objects, much like it is possible to call a same function multiple times with varying arguments. 
- It will follow quite automatically that **static members can't have a generics type**, because they should be used in a same way regardless of object types. 


##### What is okay and not
```java
        public class Person<M> {
            M language;
            M[] languageArr; //OK
            
            M toArray(){
                M[] tmpArr = new M[languageArr.length]; //Error!
            }
        }
```
- Declaring an array of generics type is okay, while instantiating a new one is not. 
- This is because **new operator** has to know exactly what type the T is during the compile time. Likewise, **instanceof** cannot be used because compiler has no way of knowing what T will be. 

#### 2. Using Generics

```java
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Person<JavaDeveloper> javaPerson = new Person<>(); // specific type of T can be ommited from JDK 1.7
        Person<JavaDeveloper> javaScriptPerson = new Person<JavaScriptDeveloper>(); //error

        Person<JavaDeveloper> groupOfJavaPersons = new Person<>();
        groupOfJavaPersons.add(new Java());
        groupOfJavaPersons.add(new JavaScript()); //error!
    }
    
    public class Programmer{}
    public class JavaDeveloper extends Programmer{}
    public class JavaScriptDeveloper extends Programmer{}
```
- This is quite self-explanatory. Once declared with specific types, the created objects won't tolerate other types to butt in.

#### 3. Limited Generics Class

- As mentioned in beginning, generics was created to lessen the burden for type-checking and casting. So far there doesn't seem to be much virtue in it. how about limiting the type **T to only take certain types of objects**?

```java
public class Person<T extends Programmer>
```
- This forces T to be **descendents** of Programmer. Hence, the below is possible.
```java
    Person<Programmer> programmerBatch = new Person<>(); 
    programmerBatch.add(new JavaDeveloper());
    programmerBatch.add(new JavaScriptDeveloper());
```


- Basically if you omit and just write **\<T\>**, it is same as \<T extends Object\>

- When it comes to implementing an interface, make sure to use **extends**, rather than the usual **implements**.

```java
    interface codable()
    class programmerBatch<T extends codable>
```

#### 4. Wildcard Expressions

- Once I bumped into this link in stackoverflow [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7573269/what-is-the-difference-between-and-t-in-class-and-method-signatures](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7573269/what-is-the-difference-between-and-t-in-class-and-method-signatures)

- After reading the adopted answer, I could still not get 100% of what the difference was. Now let's investigate. 


```java
public class Outsourcing {
    static webPage makeWebPage(Person<Programmer> box){
        String temp = "Coded by ";
        for(Programmer p : box.getList()) temp += p + " ";
        return new webPage(temp);
    }
}
```

> Above class has the following problems.
- (1) Since it is a static method, a specific type (programmer) has to be written
- (2) Because of (1), if you want to substitute **programmer** to **JavaDeveloper** or **JavaScriptDeveloper**, you have to make separte methods like

```java
      static webPage makeWebPage(Person<JavaDeveloper> box){
        String temp = "Coded by ";
        for(Programmer p : box.getList()) temp += p + " ";
        return new webPage(temp);
    }

      static webPage makeWebPage(Person<JavaScriptDeveloper> box){
        String temp = "Coded by ";
        for(Programmer p : box.getList()) temp += p + " ";
        return new webPage(temp);
    }
```

- (3) However, this is NOT possible, because **having different generic types does not allow overloading**.
- (4) This can be handled with **?(wildcard)**!


>\<? extends T>  :  upper limit. T and its descendents
>\<? super T>    :  lower limit. T and its ancestors
>\<?>            :  no limit. same as <? extends Object>

- Converting the problematic **makeWebPage** function,

```java
 static webPage makeWebPage(Person<? extends Programmer> box){
        ...
    }
```
- Now this **makeWebPage** can accomodate JavaDevelopers and JavaScriptDevelopers at once! (and any of Programmer's descendets)


- Going back to the [link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7573269/what-is-the-difference-between-and-t-in-class-and-method-signatures), I can conclude that **Generic type T is a compile-time decided consistent type for class**, whereas **wildcard is an expression limiting the range of types**. Those two are not of same nature, the former being a grammar and the latter a little like a hack.

#### 5. Generic Method

```java
    static <T> void sort(List<T> list, Comparator<? super T> c)
```
- The **T** in method and **T** in class are 'totally different' things. They may or may not be the same, and utterly unrelated.

```java
 static webPage makeWebPage(Person<? extends Programmer> box){
        ...
    } //can be changed into ...

 static Person<? extends Programmer> webPage makeWebPage(Person<T> box){
        ...
    }
```

- Below is some tricky example
```java
    public static <T extends Comparable<? super T>> void sort(List <T> list)
```

- Okay. **parameter 'list'** is of type T that is a **decendents of Comparable<? super T>** for one.
- The comparable interface compares **T or its ancestors**.
- If the list is given as **JavaDevelopers**, the comparable compares **JavaDevelopers, Programmers and Persons and Objects**
