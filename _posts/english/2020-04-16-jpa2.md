### Prelude

In the previous post, I navigated the basic settings for testing JPA (https://tlonist-sang.github.io/jpa-1/)[https://tlonist-sang.github.io/jpa-1/].
In this post, I will explain how the relations Java objects have are translated to Database tables and more.

### 1. Relations

- It should be made clear once again that ORM is a trial to navigate persisted data as if one manipulates the **Collection** API of Java. 
- For RDBMS, setting up a primary key for one table and referencing it through a foreign key makes two tables bi-directional. Whereas for objects, you have to make each of the object to contain the other, like below.

```java
class A{ B b;}
class B{ A a;}
```
- For objects in java, the bi-direnctional referencing (A.b or B.a) is actually **double mono-directional referencing**. Hence to transplant this to the database, one has to have the foreign key of the other, and from here the concept of **owning side of a relationship** is created.

#### 1-0. Owning Side of a relationship
- Suppose a project has a class **Account**, and a class **Team** that contains multiple accounts.

```java
  @Entity
  public class Account extends BaseEntity{
      @Id @GeneratedValue
      @Column(name="ACCOUNT_ID")
      private Long id;

      @ManyToOne
      @JoinColumn(name="TEAM_ID")
      private Team team;
  }

  @Entity
  public class Team extends BaseEntity{
      @Id @GeneratedValue
      @Column(name="TEAM_ID")
      private Long id;

  //    @OneToMany (mappedBy="team")
  //    List<Account> accounts = new ArrayList<>();
  }
```

- Thinking how this structure should be stored in database, you can think of two options.

1) Account contains the foreign key of team.

| Account                                      | Team                 |
|----------------------------------------------|----------------------|
| primary key account_id; foreign key team_id; | primary key team_id; |

2) Team contains the foreign keys of members

| Account                 | Team                                         |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| primary key account_id; | primary key team_id; foreign key account_id; |

- If you think just for a moment, you will find out that 2) method is very undesirable, because if team contains 10,000 accounts, it will have 10,000 primary keys of account_id. For 1), no matter how big a team is, one account will have one team(let's say for commonsense's sake), hence it is logical for Account to have the foreign key of the team.

- We call the entity which holds the foreign key to be **owning side of a relationship**. In this case, it is **Account.team**. The other side has to be noted with **mappedBy** option for bi-direnctional referencing. 

```java
@Entity
public class Team extends BaseEntity{
    @Id @GeneratedValue
    @Column(name="TEAM_ID")
    private Long id;

   @OneToMany (mappedBy="team")
   List<Account> accounts = new ArrayList<>();
}
```
- From the example above, class Team is **read only** when it comes to dealing with accounts array. ***Common mistakes*** are,
```java
  Team team = new Team();
  team.setName("Team1");
  entityManager.persist(team);

  Account account = new Account();
  account.setName("eric");

  team.getAccounts().add(account);
  entityManager.persist(account);
```
- The above code will bring the result like below.

> When mapping a bi-directional relation, the insert has to be made on the owning side of the relationship.
```java
  Team team = new Team();
  team.setName("Team1");
  entityManager.persist(team);

  Account account = new Account();
  account.setName("eric");
  team.getAccounts().add(account);

  account.setTeam(team);
  entityManager.persist(account);
```
[![img]({{ "/assets/img/jpa2-2.png"|absolute_url}})]({{ "/assets/img/jpa2-2.png"|absolute_url}})

- It is generally recommended to modify the getter & setter for Team to include these aspects.
```java
@Entity
public class Team extends BaseEntity{
   //...
   
   @OneToMany (mappedBy="team")
   List<Account> accounts = new ArrayList<>();

   public void addAccount(Account account){
      accounts.add(account);
      account.setTeam(this);
   }
}
```

#### 1-1. @ManyToOne, @OneToMany
- @ManyToOne is the most frequently used relation mapping. As noted eariler, the one with FK(foreign key) is the owning side of a relationship. 

#### 1-2. @OneToOne
- @OneToOne is quite similar to @ManyToOne in that the one with FK is the owning side of the relationship. Rest is plain.

#### 1-3. @ManyToMany
- Unless really absolutely needed, @ManyToMany is not recommended in most cases. (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7339143/why-no-many-to-many-relationships)[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7339143/why-no-many-to-many-relationships]
- @ManyToMany automatically generates an interfacing table linking the two tables of interest.

```java
 List<Team> teamList = new ArrayList<>();
            List<Flag> flagList = new ArrayList<>();

            Team team1 = new Team("A");
            Team team2 = new Team("B");

            Flag flag1 = new Flag("Blue");
            Flag flag2 = new Flag("Green");

            teamList.add(team1);
            teamList.add(team2);

            flagList.add(flag1);
            flagList.add(flag2);

            team1.setFlags(flagList);
            team2.setFlags(flagList);

            flag1.setTeams(teamList);
            flag2.setTeams(teamList);

            em.persist(team1);
            em.persist(team2);
            em.persist(flag1);
            em.persist(flag2);

            em.flush();
            em.clear();
```
- Executing above code results in the status below.

### 2. Inheritance
- Objects can be inherited to and from other objects. In JPA, the concept of Inheritance is achieved using **SuperType and SubType**. There is no concept that directly matches with the idea of inheritance in Database. There are three main strategies in mimicking inhertance.


#### 2-1. @Inheritance types
```java
@Inheritance(strategy=InheritanceType.JOINED)
@Inheritance(strategy=InheritanceType.SINGLE_TABLE)
@Inheritance(strategy=InheritanceType.TABLE_PER_CLASS)
```
- Let's say there is ITEM class which serves as a parent of classes Album, Book and Movie.

```java
@Entity
@Inheritance(strategy = InheritanceType.)
@Table(name="items")
public abstract class Item {
    @Id @GeneratedValue
    private Long id;

    private String name;
    private int price;
    private String country;
}

@Entity
public class Album extends Item {
    private String artist;
}
@Entity
public class Book extends Item {
    private String product;
    private String isbn;
}
@Entity
public class Movie extends Item {
    private String director;
    private String actor;
}
```

> ***JOINED*** Strategy: this strategy creates parent class table AND child class tables all separately.
- The parent class created with JOINED has a special column called DTYPE, which is used to join subclasses. 
```java
@Entity
@Inheritance(strategy = InheritanceType.JOINED)
public a


```console
  Hibernate: 
      create table Album (
        artist varchar(255),
          id bigint not null,
          primary key (id)
      )
  Hibernate:   
      create table Book (
        isbn varchar(255),
          product varchar(255),
          id bigint not null,
          primary key (id)
      )
  Hibernate:     
      create table Movie (
        actor varchar(255),
          director varchar(255),
          id bigint not null,
          primary key (id)
      )
  Hibernate: 
      create table items (
        DTYPE varchar(31) not null,
          id bigint not null,
          country varchar(255),
          name varchar(255),
          price integer not null,
          primary key (id)
      )
```

- When inserting a child object, you can see that the query is inserted twice from the console below.
```java
    Movie movie = new Movie();
    movie.setDirector("aa");
    movie.setActor("bb");
    movie.setName("GoneWithTheWind");
    movie.setPrice(10000);

    em.persist(movie);
    em.flush();
    em.clear();
```

```console
Hibernate: 
    /* insert Test.products.Movie
        */ insert 
        into
            items
            (country, name, price, DTYPE, id) 
        values
            (?, ?, ?, 'M', ?)
Hibernate: 
    /* insert Test.products.Movie
        */ insert 
        into
            Movie
            (actor, director, id) 
        values
            (?, ?, ?)
```

- @DiscriminatorColumn and @DiscrimitatorValue can be used to denote customized name for child class tables.
```java
@DiscriminatorValue("M")
public class Movie extends Item {}
```
[![img]({{ "/assets/img/jpa2-3.png"|absolute_url}})]({{ "/assets/img/jpa2-3.png"|absolute_url}})
- You can see that the DTYPE for Movie is marked as "M"

> ***SINGLE_TABLE*** Strategy: This creates ONLY ONE table for parent and child classes.
```java
@Entity
@Inheritance(strategy = InheritanceType.SINGLE_TABLE)
public abstract class Item {}
```
- Executing above Movie insertion query,
```console
  Hibernate: 
        create table items (
        DTYPE varchar(31) not null,
          id bigint not null,
          country varchar(255),
          name varchar(255),
          price integer not null,
          actor varchar(255),
          director varchar(255),
          artist varchar(255),
          isbn varchar(255),
          product varchar(255),
          primary key (id)
      )
  Hibernate: 
      /* insert Test.products.Movie
          */ insert 
          into
              items
              (country, name, price, actor, director, DTYPE, id) 
          values
              (?, ?, ?, ?, ?, 'M', ?)
```

- Only one insert query is executed.
- Unused child table columns are filled with NULL values.

> ***TABLE_PER_CLASS*** Strategy: There are only Child class tables (no parent class table!)
```java
@Entity
@Inheritance(strategy = InheritanceType.TABLE_PER_CLASS)
public abstract class Item {}
```
- Likewise, inserting a Movie object, you get
```console
Hibernate: 
    create table Album (
       id bigint not null,
        country varchar(255),
        name varchar(255),
        price integer not null,
        artist varchar(255),
        primary key (id)
    )
Hibernate: 
    create table Book (
       id bigint not null,
        country varchar(255),
        name varchar(255),
        price integer not null,
        isbn varchar(255),
        product varchar(255),
        primary key (id)
    )
Hibernate: 
    create table Movie (
       id bigint not null,
        country varchar(255),
        name varchar(255),
        price integer not null,
        actor varchar(255),
        director varchar(255),
        primary key (id)
    )

Hibernate: 
/* insert Test.products.Movie
    */ insert 
    into
        Movie
        (country, name, price, actor, director, id) 
    values
        (?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?)
```


- Though this seems quite ideal at first sight, the queries from this strategy can be quite hideous. Suppose you are retrieving a Move entity using Item object, as can be naturally done in Object world.

```java
 Item item = em.find(Item.class, movie.getId());
 System.out.println("Name:"+item.getName()+" Price:"+item.getPrice());
```
- And below is the result..!

```console
Hibernate: 
    select
        item0_.id as id1_3_0_,
        item0_.country as country2_3_0_,
        item0_.name as name3_3_0_,
        item0_.price as price4_3_0_,
        item0_.actor as actor1_4_0_,
        item0_.director as director2_4_0_,
        item0_.artist as artist1_1_0_,
        item0_.isbn as isbn1_2_0_,
        item0_.product as product2_2_0_,
        item0_.clazz_ as clazz_0_ 
    from
        ( select
            id,
            country,
            name,
            price,
            actor,
            director,
            null as artist,
            null as isbn,
            null as product,
            1 as clazz_ 
        from
            Movie 
        union
        all select
            id,
            country,
            name,
            price,
            null as actor,
            null as director,
            artist,
            null as isbn,
            null as product,
            2 as clazz_ 
        from
            Album 
        union
        all select
            id,
            country,
            name,
            price,
            null as actor,
            null as director,
            null as artist,
            isbn,
            product,
            3 as clazz_ 
        from
            Book 
    ) item0_ 
where
    item0_.id=?
Name:GoneWithTheWind Price:10000
```

- Likewise, there can be some complications if you want to query by parent entity. There are some other disadvantages regarding this strategy that seniors don't recommend, but I am yet to clarify them. I will just not use it!
- For convenience's purpose, it is recommended to make parent class **abstract**, so that it does not instantiate by itself.

Here is a brief recap of PROs and CONs of each strategy.

| Account | JOINED                                                                    | SINGLE_TABLE                                                  | TABLE_PER_CLASS(Just NOT recommended)                           |
|---------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| PROs    | Regularized tables/ Save space used effectively                           | No need for joining tables/ Simple select query               | Does not allow null                                             |
| CONs    | Uses lots of join query/ Complicated selection query/ Calls insert query  | Allows null values to child columns/ Table size can get large | Uses lots of union queries when selecting multiple child tables |



#### 2-2. @MappedSuperclass
- @MappedSuperclass is NOT about Inheritance; rather, it is a convenient hack for supplying mapping information to child class.
- The class annotated with @MappedSuperclass does NOT create a new table, nor does it map to any other table in the database.
- It does not provide select or search functionalities. 

```java
@MappedSuperclass
public class BaseEntity {

    private String createdBy;
    private LocalDateTime createdDate;
    private String lastModifedBy;
    private LocalDateTime lastModifiedDate;

@Entity
public class Account extends BaseEntity{
  //....
}

```java
 public static void main(String[] args) {
    EntityManagerFactory emf = Persistence.createEntityManagerFactory("jpaMain1");
    EntityManager em = emf.createEntityManager();
    EntityTransaction transaction = em.getTransaction();
    transaction.begin();
    try{
        Account account = new Account();
        account.setCreatedBy("tlonist");
        account.setAccountName("harry");
        account.setCreatedDate(LocalDateTime.now());

        em.persist(account);
        em.flush();
        em.clear();
        transaction.commit();
    }catch(Exception e){
        transaction.rollback();
    }finally{
        em.close();
    }
 }
}
```

```console
Hibernate: 
    /* insert Test.Account
        */ insert 
        into
            Account
            (createdBy, createdDate, lastModifedBy, lastModifiedDate, name, cover, createDate, roleType, TEAM_ID, ACCOUNT_ID) 
        values
            (?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?)
```

Okay, this was a rather long post. To sum up what I had covered,

1. What **an owning side of a relationship** is. With examples of sample code and console results. 
2. How **Inheritance** can be made with JPA with its strategies.
